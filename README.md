## **Project Overview**

In an increasingly competitive airline industry, companies must continuously innovate to maintain profitability. This project focuses on analyzing airline flight data to discover opportunities for increasing occupancy rates, particularly in low-performing flights. By enhancing occupancy, the airline can optimize revenue per flight and, consequently, increase overall profitability.

---

## **Objective**

The goal of this project is to leverage SQL and Python for a comprehensive analysis of airline data. We aim to identify low-performing flights and provide actionable recommendations to improve occupancy rates, which are directly linked to profitability.

---

## **Motivation**

Given the tight profit margins in the airline industry, it’s essential to maximize every seat's profitability. Stricter environmental regulations, rising fuel prices, and increased labor costs have put pressure on profits. This project was motivated by the need to explore how data analysis can drive operational efficiencies and improve financial outcomes.

---

## **Approach**

1. **Data Collection:**
   - Connect to the airline's SQL database.
   - Extract data related to flights, routes, occupancy rates, and associated costs.
2. **Data Preprocessing:**

   - Clean and preprocess the data to ensure accuracy.
   - Handle missing values, duplicates, and outliers.

3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):**
   - Perform an in-depth analysis to identify trends, patterns, and correlations.
   - Focus on identifying low-performing flights and routes.
4. **SQL Queries:**
   - Write SQL queries to extract key metrics and insights from the dataset.
   - Analyze data on a granular level to uncover actionable insights.
5. **Data Visualization:**
   - Use Python’s visualization libraries to create compelling visuals that highlight key findings.
   - Present the data in a way that is easy to understand for stakeholders.
6. **Recommendations:**
   - Based on the analysis, provide recommendations to increase occupancy and profitability.
   - Focus on data-driven strategies such as dynamic pricing, targeted promotions, and route optimization.

## **Dataset Overview**

The dataset utilized in this project includes the following key components:

- **Flight Information:** Details about each flight, including flight ID, date, time, route, and duration.
- **Route Data:** Information on the origin and destination of each flight.
- **Passenger Load:** Number of passengers on each flight.
- **Operational Costs:** Data on costs associated with each flight, including fuel and labor.
- **Revenue Data:** Information on the revenue generated by each flight.

The dataset spans multiple years, providing a robust foundation for trend analysis and forecasting.

## **Technologies Used**

This project employs a combination of SQL and Python to analyze and visualize data:

### **SQL:**

- Used for querying and manipulating data within the airline database.
- Complex queries were developed to extract relevant insights.

### **Python:**

- **Libraries Used:**
  - `sqlite3` for database connection and querying.
  - `pandas` for data manipulation and analysis.
  - `matplotlib` and `seaborn` for data visualization.
  - `numpy` for numerical operations.
  - `scipy` for statistical analysis.
- **Tools:**
  - **Jupyter Notebook:** Used for code development and interactive analysis.
  - **Git:** Version control for tracking changes and collaboration.

---

## **Detailed Workflow**

### **1. Data Collection:**

- Connected to the airline's SQL database using `sqlite3`.
- Executed SQL queries to fetch data on flights, routes, and passenger counts.

### **2. Data Preprocessing:**

- **Data Cleaning:**
  - Removed duplicate records to ensure data integrity.
  - Addressed missing values by either filling or removing them based on context.
- **Data Transformation:**
  - Created new features from existing data, such as occupancy rate and profit per seat.

### **3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):**

- **Descriptive Statistics:**
  - Calculated mean, median, and standard deviation to understand data distribution.
- **Correlation Analysis:**
  - Analyzed correlations between variables like occupancy rate, route, and profitability.
- **Outlier Detection:**
  - Identified and handled outliers that could skew the analysis.

### **4. SQL Query Execution:**

- **Low-Performing Flights:**
  - Identified flights with occupancy rates below a certain threshold.
- **Route Profitability:**
  - Analyzed which routes generate the most revenue and which are underperforming.
- **Time of Day Analysis:**
  - Investigated the impact of flight timing on occupancy and profitability.

### **5. Data Visualization:**

- **Occupancy Rate Analysis:**
  - Visualized occupancy rates across different routes and time periods.
- **Profitability Heatmaps:**
  - Created heatmaps to show the most and least profitable routes.
- **Time Series Analysis:**
  - Visualized trends over time to identify seasonal patterns.

---

## **Key Analysis & Insights**

### **Occupancy Rate Analysis:**

- Identified several low-performing flights with occupancy rates below 50%.
- Noted that certain routes consistently underperform, particularly during off-peak times.

### **Route Profitability:**

- Discovered that certain high-occupancy routes do not necessarily translate to higher profitability due to varying operational costs.
- Recommended shifting focus to more profitable routes even if they have slightly lower occupancy rates.

### **Time of Day Impact:**

- Flights operating during early mornings and late evenings showed lower occupancy, suggesting a need for targeted promotions or schedule adjustments.

---

## **Results**

- **Occupancy Improvement:**
  - Proposed targeted marketing strategies for low-performing flights.
  - Suggested dynamic pricing models to boost occupancy rates.
- **Route Optimization:**

  - Recommended phasing out or restructuring unprofitable routes.
  - Identified routes with potential for increased frequency based on demand.

- **Revenue Impact:**
  - Implementing the recommendations could lead to a projected 5-10% increase in profit margins.

---

## **Visualizations**

Visualizations played a key role in interpreting the data. Below are a few examples:

### **1. Occupancy Rates by Route**

- Visualized to identify which routes had the lowest occupancy and needed targeted attention.

### **2. Profitability Heatmap**

- A heatmap showing which routes and times of day were the most profitable, guiding schedule optimization.

### **3. Time Series Analysis**

- Identified seasonal trends that could inform marketing campaigns and pricing strategies.

## **Conclusion**

This project successfully demonstrated how data-driven analysis can lead to actionable insights in the airline industry. By focusing on occupancy rates and profitability, we identified key areas where the airline can optimize its operations and improve financial performance.

## **Challenges Faced**

- **Data Quality:** Dealing with missing and inconsistent data was a significant challenge.
- **Computational Complexity:** Running complex SQL queries on large datasets required optimization for performance.
- **Visualization:** Ensuring that the visualizations were both informative and easy to understand required careful design.

## **Future Enhancements**

- **Machine Learning Models:** Develop predictive models to forecast low occupancy flights and proactively address them.
- **Real-Time Data Analysis:** Integrate real-time data streams for continuous monitoring and decision-making.
- **Automated Reporting:** Set up automated reporting tools to generate insights regularly

and distribute them to stakeholders.
